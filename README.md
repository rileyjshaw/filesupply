![dr. evil doing air quotes](http://i.giphy.com/qs6ev2pm8g9dS.gif)

## when?
while i was waiting for a pizza to arrive in early 2014

## how?
it uses [peerjs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs/) and their hosted connection broker. if you want to run this you'll need [your own key](http://peerjs.com/peerserver).

the interaction looks like this:

![what's your name?](walkthrough/1.png)
![what's their name?](walkthrough/2.png)
![waiting for clarinet_squid_2005...](walkthrough/3.png)
![now it's time to drag a file in](walkthrough/4.png)
![when you do, the transfer starts](walkthrough/5.png)
![and you get a nice checkmark when it finishes](walkthrough/6.png)

then clarinet_squid_2005 gets the binary dumped to their console because my pizza arrived.

from the code:

```
// (this is possible since every human goes by a unique name)
```

f.a.q.
